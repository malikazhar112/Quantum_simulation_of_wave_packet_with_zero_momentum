# Quantum_simulation_of_wave_packet_with_zero_momentum
This demonstrates a foundational result of quantum mechanics, which is that the width of a Gaussian wave packet grows with time. How does this happen? The second derivative of the magnitude of the wave function induces the phase to change, and since the second derivative is not constant (derivative of a Gaussian is a Gaussian), the rate of phase change is not constant, leading to a winding phase. The winding phase represents momentum away from the particle origin, which induces the probability to spread out over time.
